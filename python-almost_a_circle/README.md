Python - Almost a circle
Background Context
The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project will help you be ready for it.

In this project, you will review everything about Python:

Import
Exceptions
Class
Private attribute
Getter/Setter
Class method
Static method
Inheritance
Unittest
Read/Write file
You will also learn about:

args and kwargs
Serialization/Deserialization
JSON
Resources
Read or watch:

args/kwargs
JSON encoder and decoder
unittest module
Python test cheatsheet
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
How to serialize and deserialize a Class
How to write and read a JSON file
What is *args and how to use it
What is **kwargs and how to use it
How to handle named arguments in a function
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: Visual studio code
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
